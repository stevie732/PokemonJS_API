### Code Smells

* The code is not very DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself). The `fetchData()` function is called twice, once in the `DOMContentLoaded` event handler and once in the error handler. This could be refactored to call the function only once.
* The code is not very modular. The `fetchData()` function does too much. It fetches the data from the API, parses the JSON response, and sets the image source. These tasks could be broken up into separate functions.
* The code is not very secure. The `fetchData()` function does not check the authenticity of the response from the API. This could allow for a malicious actor to send a fake response and trick the code into displaying the wrong image.

### Technical Debt

The code has some technical debt that could be addressed. For example, the code does not use a promise library, which could make the code more asynchronous.

### Security Issues

The code has some security issues that could be addressed. For example, the code does not check the authenticity of the response from the API. This could allow for a malicious actor to send a fake response and trick the code into displaying the wrong image.

### Maintainability

The code is not very maintainable. The code is not very DRY and is not very modular. This makes it difficult to understand and modify the code.

### Following Patterns

The code does not follow any specific patterns. This makes it difficult to understand and modify the code.

### Following Best Practices

The code does not follow some best practices. For example, the code does not use a promise library.

### Potential Amount of Bugs

The code has the potential for a few bugs. For example, the code does not check the authenticity of the response from the API. This could allow for a malicious actor to send a fake response and trick the code into displaying the wrong image.

### Number of Code Duplicates

The code has some code duplication. For example, the `fetchData()` function is called twice. This could be refactored to call the function only once.

### Efforts Spent on This Code

It is difficult to say how much effort was spent on this code. However, it seems like the code was not written by a senior developer.

### Score from 1 to 12, Based on the Level of Seniority
